GPGBoard

Introduction
------------

GPGBoard is hastily named and coded OSX tool for quickly signing, encrypting,
decrypting, and verifying signatures of PGP blocks. Primarily, it should be used
in combination with [GPGTools](https://www.gpgtools.org) for key management. 
This tool simply provides a GUI method to the four simple tasks that are
difficult to do within a program that has no GnuPG integration, e.g.
Sparrow Mail.
